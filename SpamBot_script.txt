Sometimes the smallest of things...

trigger memories so

strange and so beautiful...

that they leave us speechless...

Memories are a funny thing...

The small pieces of our past.

They are always safe in our memories.

Memories are like chocolate boxes...

Once open...

you can't stop at just one.

What are you looking at?

Watch TV if you want

something to stare at!
